Due to the computer science and IT security background I obtained with my Bachelors degree and especially my thesis, I was tasked to help counseling in the decision for a new monitoring solution for the ERP *Workday*.

After discussing with stakeholders from the organisation wide monitoring group (that acts on alerts), the security engineering group (that supports in enabling the solution) and the admins of the ERP (that effectively have to maintain the solution), which I shared the office with and were my clients, we decided on using *Splunk*. This decision was taken, because Splunk was already deployed in parts of the organisation (so there was support), the other monitoring software in the organisation was not powerful enough for the expectations of the clients and introducing a new monitoring solution was not possible, as it would need to much resources.

First tests of how well *Splunk* works with *Workday*, for which I also received the *Splunk Fundamentals 1* training, were successfull after some work and *Splunk* is still a progressing project in the organisation.
