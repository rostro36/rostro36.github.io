## CV
Or if you want all this information in a single page or a [PDF](https://rostro36.github.io/files/Jannik_Gut_CV.pdf), you can download it [here](https://rostro36.github.io/cv/).

## Hobbies
Other than working on computer science projects I enjoy hiking up mountains and climbing some smaller hills with my bicycle in the summer.

When that is not possible due to the season I go skiing or as a last resort go jogging to stay healthy.

This physical activity is badly needed since I stress my digestive system often with cakes or other desserts that I made myself and I also stress my heart too much by supporting Chelsea F.C.  in England and the local teams F.C. Luzern and EV Zug in Switzerland too much. (Thankfully, the local bicycle rider stopped riding for GCs.)

When I read about them in the local newspaper I usually also read the rest about national and international politics and the economy.
