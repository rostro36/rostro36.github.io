# Hardware Projects
- One of my first projects was using a **BananaPi** to play MP3s that I specified via bash. Afterwards it was used as a Pi-Hole.
- Throughout my studies and the surrounding hardware projects I used different distributions of **Linux**, namely Arch Linux, Linux Mint, Raspbian (Debian) and Ubuntu. 
- Another project was using an old computer as a **server** with Ubuntu Server, unfortunately it was not very successful as the server was not powerful enough, e.g. not even 1GB RAM.
# Software Projects
- [NLZMarkov](https://github.com/rostro36/NLZMarkov) scraped the local newspaper archive for a query word and formed a markov chain based on this data. There is QT-GUI to change parameters such as the length and if POS-tags should be used.
- [TdFGraph](https://github.com/rostro36/TdFgraph) forms graphs based on bicycling results.
